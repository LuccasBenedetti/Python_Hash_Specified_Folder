<h1>Python Project HSF (Hash Specified Folder)</h1>

<p>
 Hey, this is a simple project for college.
 
 The goal of this project was simply to develop a program capable of receiveing a folder directory, and hash all the files inside of it.
 As of right now, there are two sub functions included, the code can save all the hashes generated inside a .txt file, and then back it up, after which,
 we can compare it to a new file, to see if any of the previous files was modified or removed from the folder or subfolders
